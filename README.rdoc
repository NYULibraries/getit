== GetIt @ NYU
The GetIt application at NYU leverages Umlaut to provide just in time OpenURL resolution (I'm not sure what that means though).

Umlaut aggregates services for a requested citation represented by an Open URL.  That's a little better, but you should probably
just check out {Umlaut}[http://github.com/team-umlaut/umlaut].

=== NYU Customizations
At NYU we've implemented a few features in GetIt @ NYU that aren't in your basic Umlaut application.
1. Aleph Integration: we've included some Aleph functionality, most notably the ability to request Aleph items
2. SFX Solr Indexing: we've indexed SFX titles in Solr for quick retrieval using {Sunspot}[http://sunspot.github.com/]
3. User Login: we've included the ability for users to login via PDS, using {Authlogic}[http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic], {authpds}[http://github.com/scotdalton/authpds] and {authpds-nyu}[http://github.com/scotdalton/authpds]
4. UI: we've customized the UI to our liking leveraging {Twitter Bootstrap}[http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap] where appropriate.
