# UMLAUT: mysql db with mysql2 adapter strongly recommended for Umlaut, in both 
# production and development. sqlite3 has unclear semantics under threaded 
# concurrency which umlaut uses, and in many cases simply does not work. 
#
# A high (connection) pool setting is also, sadly, generally
# required at present.

#   adapter: mysql2

# UMLAUT: for the 'search' functions (A-Z title lookup) to work, you need
# a direct database connection to the SFX database, under 'sfx_db' key. 
# You should manually set up a new read-only MySQL account in the SFX db
# for this purpose, rather than use one of the full-access existing SFX
# mysql accounts.
